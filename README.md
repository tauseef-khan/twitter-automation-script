# Twitter scraping script

## Aims of repository
Create a twitter scraping script which gets past tweets with a particular hashtag. This will allow for hashtag analysis for the tweets captured.

The script will hopefully generalised so all the user has to do is input their consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_secret and other paramters which are analysis specific. This will then allow for a top level analysis of the tweets they have captured.

## Current status
Initially, the repository contains the Python notebook "CT17 (GitHub)". This essentially contains the twitter scraping script but it was developed for the "Charity Technology Conference 2017". So it is slightly geared towards that event. 

Hopefully the script will be generalised as stated in the aims so anyone can use it for their own use.
